## PRISMA flow

1. Everything starts from a new **request to be refined** (which can also be a **bug report** or a **tech debt**) in Trello
2. The request is then refined, following our **requirements gathering guidelines**, and it becomes actionable by buildo. Defects are verified to understand how to reproduce them and to make sure they are valid defects
3. The **actionable request** (again, includes defects and tech debt) is then prioritized
4. When about to work on an actionable request, it is transformed by the DEV team into a GitHub issue, and tracked as a backlog card in Trello.
5. Completion of the issue in GitHub triggers PRISMA to move the backlog card to "done".
6. In PRISMA a few more steps for approval and QA are set, depending on product needs.

We call this the **PRISMA flow**. In this section we explain in detail this flow.

The PRISMA flow is a template on which to build your specific product development flow. Each product is different, and has a different implementation of the flow; however, all the flows follow the PRISMA flow as a guideline and are:

* specified in written form _(typically in the column: "HOW TO USE THIS BOARD")_
* fully discussed and shared with the development team and the customer

All these tasks are responsibility of the PM.

This is the complete PRISMA flow:

It's divided into 4 sub workflows:

* manage requests and defects
* open issues
* develop
* ensure quality

The following 4 sections describe these workflows and their guidelines.
