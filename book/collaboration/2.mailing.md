# Mailing Lists

Together with [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/), the two means of collaboration that we already discussed, we also make use of good old mailing lists.

Every project has its own mailing list (typically `project-name@buildo.io`). You can discover and subscribe to mailing lists in [GAPS](https://gaps.our.buildo.io/subs#) or directly in [google groups](https://groups.google.com/a/buildo.io/forum/#!overview).
